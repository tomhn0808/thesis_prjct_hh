This repository contains all the scripts I personally developed for my thesis project at Halmstad University. The goal is to provide a robust framework for real‑time resource monitoring of any application—tracking both parent and child processes to deliver accurate CPU and memory usage statistics.

Full research and methodology are detailed in my thesis, available here: https://hh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1872390
