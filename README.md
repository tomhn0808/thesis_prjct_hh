This repository contains all the scripts I personally developed for my thesis project at Halmstad University. The goal is to provide scripts for real‑time resource monitoring of any application—tracking both parent and child processes to deliver accurate CPU and memory usage statistics. Additionaly, this repository contains all code used to create and label a dataset of Trojan Horse malware.

**Full research and methodology** are detailed in my thesis, available here: [Halmstad University DIVA portal](https://hh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1872390).
